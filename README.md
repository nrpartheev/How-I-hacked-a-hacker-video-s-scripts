# How-I-hacked-a-hacker-video-s-scripts
This repo contains all the codes which I used in the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOANgy5w5Ng

The naming of the file is bad I know.. 

instances.py -> shows all the instances in google
printdata.py -> shows all the tables with data
searchterm.py ->  shows all the file which has all the search pattern
